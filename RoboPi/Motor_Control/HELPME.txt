Please SSH from another computer to this pi.

After type: sudo python RUNME.py

Also make sure to go to your pi's IP address on your browser to see the video stream.

You will be prompted with asking what direction to move in:
	W : Forwards
	A : Rotate Left
	S : Stop
	D : Rotate Right

Then you will be prompted to say how long to move in that direction in seconds.
	

	At anytime prompted for a direction, if you type terminate exactly, it will 
	finish the program. THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR A PROPER SHUTDOWN!
